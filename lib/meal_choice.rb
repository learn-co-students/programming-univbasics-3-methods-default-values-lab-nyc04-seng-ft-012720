# Define a Return Value
# The hosts are going the meal information to keep track of what everyone is eating, so make sure the return value includes the three food items you've chosen by returning: "A plate of #{protein} with #{veg1} and #{veg2}."

# Note: An explicit or implicit return can be used.
